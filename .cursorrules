RULE 1:
Do not try to run psql or supabase commands directly. Instead, print out the full query and ask the user to run it in the supabase console.

RULE 2:
Any reads from the database should be done through the supabase client and have realtime enabled. Any writes should be handled in the API layer. 

RULE 3:
All types should be defined in the `types` directory. Never create a type within a component file.

RULE 4:
All new UI features should have relevant tests added to our cypress test suite.

RULE 5:
All new components should be added to the `@/app/components` directory not `@/components` which is only used for shadcn UI components.

RULE 6:
For any cypress tests, use the existing test users, do not create new users. If you feel that a new user is needed, prompt the developer to create one.
