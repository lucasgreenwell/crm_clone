## 5. Data and API Considerations

### 5.1 Core Architecture
- **Ticket Data Model:**  
  - **Standard Identifiers & Timestamps:** Ticket ID, creation date, last updated date, etc.  
  - **Flexible Metadata:**  
    - Dynamic status tracking (open, pending, resolved, on-hold, etc.).  
    - Priority levels (customizable scaling from High/Medium/Low or numerical).  
    - Custom fields (e.g., product type, internal department).  
    - Tags (e.g., “VIP Customer,” “Refund Request”).  
    - Internal notes (only visible to internal teams).  
    - Full conversation history (all customer-agent interactions).  
    - Designed to be a “living document” capturing the entire customer interaction journey.
- **API-First Design:**  
  - **Integration:** Seamlessly connect with websites, mobile apps, third-party tools.  
  - **Automation:** Endpoints for common tasks (ticket creation, assignment, updates).  
  - **AI Enhancements:** Provide endpoints for LLM-based suggestions, summary generation.  
  - **Analytics:** Offer endpoints to pull raw data for reporting.
- **API Features:**  
  - Synchronous endpoints for real-time ticket updates, agent status updates.  
  - Webhooks for event-driven notifications (e.g., ticket creation, status changes, or feedback submission).  
  - Granular permissions with API key authentication and role-based scopes.

### 5.2 Data Management

  - Audit logging for all changes (who, when, what).  
  - Archival strategies for older or resolved tickets, with quick retrieval for compliance or reference.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - **Caching:** For frequently accessed data (e.g., knowledge base articles, user profiles).  
  - **Query Optimization:** Indexing on ticket fields (priority, status, tags).  
  - **Scalable Storage:** Separate storage for large attachments (images, documents).  
  - **Regular Maintenance:** Scheduled tasks for cleaning up logs, rebuilding indexes.

## 6. Technical Best Practices

### Microservices Architecture
- Separate services for ticket management, user management, knowledge base, chat, etc.  
- Each service exposes well-defined REST or GraphQL endpoints, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure employees, admins, and customers only see what they are allowed to.  
- Encrypted data at rest (especially for sensitive fields like user credentials, PII).  
- HTTPS/TLS for data in transit.  
- OWASP best practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

### LLM Integration
- Securely integrate with LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, etc.).  
- Cache AI suggestions for quick retrieval and cost optimization.  
- Fine-tune or customize LLM models with domain-specific support data if necessary.  
- Provide human validation or override for all AI-generated responses to maintain quality control.

### Observability and Monitoring
- Centralized logging to track errors, performance, and usage.  
- Health checks and alerts for microservices.  
- Analytics dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Kibana) for real-time insights.

### Scalability
- Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for easy horizontal scaling.  
- Auto-scaling policies triggered by CPU/memory usage, queue size, or request rates.
